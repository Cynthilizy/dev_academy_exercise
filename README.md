# Helsinki Bike Trip Tracker

This is a React application that shows bike trips in the Helsinki area. The application is built using Node.js and MariaDB database to store and retrieve data. It allows users to add new trips or delete existing ones, and displays the most recent 100 trips by default (which can be changed if need). However, in the station view, the real total number of trips is shown for all months or a particular month selected.
since i only had data for three months thats the ones available in this application.
i have deployed my database and React application to google cloud so you can have access to view it by following this address `http://34.88.61.34:3000`
the config file was changed to suit this purpose. 
the database schema is in the docker-db folder (to give you an idea how it was created using sql)
if you are here to get an idea to build something similar, feel free to clone or download this code
